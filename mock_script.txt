INT. NEON-LIT DINER - NIGHT

Rain streaks down the large window, blurring the city lights outside. KAELEN (30s), looking tired, sips a coffee. On the table next to his cup is a worn, leather-bound journal.

ANYA (20s), energetic and sharp, slides into the booth opposite him. She places a small, silver data chip on the table.

ANYA
You were hard to find.

KAELEN
(Without looking up)
That was the point. Did you bring it?
Anya nods towards the data chip. Kaelen eyes it, then finally meets her gaze.

KAELEN
Is it everything we need?
 
ANYA
And more. But we have to move now. They know.
Kaelen picks up the data chip, his expression grim. He slips it into his pocket, leaving the journal on the table as he stands up.

FADE OUT.
