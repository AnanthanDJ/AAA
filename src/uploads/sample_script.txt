[SCENE START]

INT. JAKE'S GARAGE - DAY

JAKE (30s), covered in grease, is tinkering with a classic motorcycle. A shiny new HELMET sits on a workbench next to a rusty WRENCH.

JANE (30s) enters, holding a steaming MUG.

JANE
Still at it? You've been in here all morning.

JAKE
(wiping his hands)
Almost got it. This old thing just needs a little love. And maybe a new carburetor.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The motorcycle roars down the open highway. Jake is driving, Jane is behind him, holding on tight. The sun glints off the chrome.
